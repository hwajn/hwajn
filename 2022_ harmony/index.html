<div class="index indexdesc"><div class="comp_bolddescription">Emergence, healing, energy&mdash;these are keywords which began a wayfaring journey into the creation of a seal and logo for Ka Yan's healing, online presence. 


  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Ka Yan is a multidisciplinary artist and creative hailing from Hong Kong who has exhibited at the NY Art Book Fair 2018 at MoMA PS1, and her book, "520", can be found in the collections of the Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library of the Metropolitan Museum and the Asian Art Archive in America.
    Director, artist, writer&mdash;Ka Yan now travels another tendril of creation as a healer. She shares her being with you in HARMONY, a newsletter where her honest process is recorded and made bare. 
   What better represents Ka Yan and HARMONY than the first character of her name&mdash;家 which means "home". The evolution of the character was studied, and we fell upon a form that is neither here nor there. I strove to bring out the emotion and history of this character, using ink calligraphy to capture its essence on paper. This was then used to create a negative stencil by which gradient pencil dotting was applied, forming the very emergence we sought to visualize.
   To ensure that the textured essence was well-visualized no matter the environment, two versions—a finely dotted seal, and a medium sized, screentone-patterned logo (slide 2) were hand drawn and pencil-dotted, meant to live in a large format and small format, respectively.
